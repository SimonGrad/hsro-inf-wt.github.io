# Assignment 3: Basic Javascript

For this assignment, use an online REPL, such as https://repl.it/languages/javascript


## Getting Started

Write a function that accepts a name, and writes `Hello, <Name>` to the console. and call it with (for example) your name.


## Basic Functions

Write a function that computes the fibonacci numbers `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...`.
One way to compute those is to use recursion `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`, where `fib(0) == 0` and `fib(1) == fib(2) == 1`.

> Note: This recursive function explodes for larger `n`; can you write a function that runs more efficiently?


## A Basic Class

Implement the given class `Person`, and create an array of `Person` by iterating over the following array:

```javascript
var data = [
	["Hans", 1998],
	["Susan", 2001],
	["Peter", 1974]
];
```


## Closures

Write a function that takes greeting (eg. "Hello") as input, and outputs a function, that takes name (eg. "world") and returns a concatenation of the greeting and the name (eg. "Hello, world!").

Call this function for different greetings and names.


## Transforming Data

The following code retrieves today's meal plan for the cafeteria, and calls `processMenu` on success with the data stored as (JSON) object.

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', '//openmensa.org/api/v2/canteens/229/days/20171026/meals');
xhr.onload = function() {
  console.log('meh');
    if (xhr.status === 200) {
        var data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        processMenu(data);
    }
    else {
        console.log('Request failed.  Returned status of ' + xhr.status);
    }
};
xhr.send();

/** 
	Takes the openmensa JSON output and transforms it into
	an array of Meal instances.
*/
function processData(data) {
	// TODO

	return ???
}
```

Analyze the resulting object and transform it into an array of `Meal` instances.

![Meal UML](/assets/meal.svg)

1. Implement the class `Meal`; what ingredients make a meal vegan, vegetarian or gluten free?
2. Define and implement the function `processMenu` to make the callback work.
	It should return an array of the main dishes, allocated as `Meal`s.
