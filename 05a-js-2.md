# Assignment 5: Intermediate Javascript

The following contains a rather lengthy list of exercises.
Try to solve at least a few of each, but make sure you do _Modifying the DOM_ and _Cafeteria, take two._


## Modifying Individual Elements

Complete the following exercises:
- [Exercise 1](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_elements1)
- [Exercise 2](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_elements2)
- [Exercise 3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_elements3)
- [Exercise 4](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_elements4)
- [Exercise 5](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_elements5)


## Add Interaction to Elements

Complete the following exercises:
- [Exercise 1](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_events1)
- [Exercise 2](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_events2)
- [Exercise 3](https://www.w3schools.com/js/exercise.asp?filename=exercise_dom_events3)


## Modifying the DOM

Check out [this fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/sikoried/co8jtb00/).
Modify it so that you if you click the buttons, the text from the input field is added to the `<ul>`, either on top, or at the bottom.

You may want to look up the documentation of [`.insertBefore`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/insertBefore) and [`.appendChild`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild).

Bonus points for:
- clearing the text field after each button click
- setting the focus (cursor) on the text field after a line was added
- making it so that if you press the `ENTER` key in the input field, it appends to the list. 
	Hint: Google for `onkeyup` and _key codes_; similar to the `this` variable, you can use `event` in the `html` text.

## Cafeteria, take two.

Recall last weeks [cafeteria example](/04a-js-1/).
The openmensa API returned a rather complicated JSON object, which was then transformed into a list of `Meal`s.

[This fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/sikoried/Lsb60sg1/) has a basic version of the networking code (retrieving the plan) as well as the logic to transform the result into an array of `Meal`s.
Your task is to

1. Refactor the `xhr` call to a jQuery `$.ajax` call; use the `done()` function to process the data and callback.
2. Implement the `renderMenu(meals)` function which should first delete all rows of the existing table (`tbody`; see `.empty()`), and then populate the table with the meals, setting the row class to `.danger` or `.warning` if the meal is vegan or vegetarian.
