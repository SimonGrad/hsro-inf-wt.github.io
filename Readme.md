## Syllabus
- **Introduction (Oct 5, [slides](/01s-intro/), [assignments](/01a-tools/))**
	
	With a few examples we dig right into the necessary tools for a web developer: git, editor, developer tools, and if course: [Google](https://www.google.com), [SO](https://www.stackoverflow.com) and the pages of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

- **HTML (Oct 12, [slides](/02s-html/), [lecture notes](/02ln-html/), [assignments](/02a-html/))**

	The *hypertext markup language* is the backbone of all web sites, and its technically a descriptive (not a programming) language.
	We'll use it to encode the _information_ that we want to present, but (ideally) not the looks.

- **CSS (Oct 19, [slides](/03s-css/), [lecture notes](/03ln-css/), [assignments](/03a-css/))**

	Use *cascading stylesheets* to render your HTML into the looks you want.
	
- **JavaScript, pt. 1 (Oct 26, [slides](/04s-js-1/), [lecture notes](/04ln-js-1/), [assignments](/04a-js-1/))**
