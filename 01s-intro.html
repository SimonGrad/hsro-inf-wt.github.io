# Intermission

## _this is your chance to opt out_

---

# Before we get started

## Why do I **not** believe in PHP/ZEND?

> _Caution: This is my professional opinion, not necessarily facts._

- PHP is interpreted; if you put (non-cachable) PHP into your web sites, they need to be processed before serving.
- PHP is (sort of) hard to scale; static pages are trivial (CDN)
- load/scaling problems immediately result in rendering delays
- Bugtracking can be pretty hard/painful
- Automated testing requires to spin up a local php interpreter

# Recommended textbooks

Web development happens on the internet, not your reading couch.

Problem at hand? Google it and you'll find a tutorial.
