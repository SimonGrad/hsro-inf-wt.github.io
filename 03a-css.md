Notes: 
- There is no need to change anything in the HTML.
- The header is on top of everything, i.e. the text should "scroll away" under it.
- The font in the header and footer are without serifs.
- When scrolled to the very top, the first heading should be fully visible (and not buried below the header).
- The main content has a margin to the sides (about `20px`).
- You may want to use combinators to differentiate between `p` tags in the header or footer.
